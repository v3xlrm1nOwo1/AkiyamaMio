> Welcome to the Akiyama Mio Model

## Overview
It's foolish to say this because I haven't trained Mio yet for financial reasons, but Mio is NLP model capable of generating anime lyrics.

The base model used is <a href='https://huggingface.co/lightblue/karasu-1.1B'>lightblue/karasu-1.1B</a> it is well trained on Japanese language data. The database used is <a href='https://huggingface.co/datasets/v3xlrm1nOwo1/AnimeSongsLyrics'>v3xlrm1nOwo1/AnimeSongsLyrics</a> I collected and cleaned this data myself It contains 23 thousand anime songs and related information and it is available in an account on huggingface <a href="https://huggingface.co/v3xlrm1nOwo1/">v3xlrm1nOwo1</a>. and in mio training I use 400 number of episodes with learning rate 3e-6. this model would be great if you could train it
